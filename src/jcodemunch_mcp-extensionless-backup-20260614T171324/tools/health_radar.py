"""Six-axis health radar + diff helper (todo.md item #5).

Compresses the existing risk-profile signals into a normalized 0–100 score
per axis plus a composite + letter grade. Same shape works as a *state*
snapshot at HEAD or as a *delta* between two snapshots — that's how PR-
time diff-grade reports get computed (run radar on base branch, run
radar on PR branch, diff the two payloads).

The radar pulls inputs from the existing tools (no new heavy work):

| Axis            | Source                                   |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| complexity      | `get_repo_health.avg_complexity`         |
| dead_code       | `get_repo_health.dead_code_pct`          |
| cycles          | `get_repo_health.cycle_count`            |
| coupling        | unstable_modules / total_files           |
| test_gap        | (1 - `get_untested_symbols.reached_pct`) |
| churn_surface   | top-1 hotspot score from `get_hotspots`  |

Higher score = healthier. Penalties are linear and conservative —
calibration tuned so a typical "average" codebase lands around C.

Methodology is auditable via `--explain` on `jcodemunch-mcp claude-md`
or by reading the `_PER_AXIS_SCORERS` table below; PR an updated
formula if you have better calibration data.
