"""get_watch_status — surface watch-all state to agents.

Reports every locally-indexed repo the watch-all daemon would cover, each
repo's current reindex state (fresh / in-progress / stale / failing), and
the OS-level service status. Intended for agents to consult before relying
on a potentially stale index.

v1.106.0: also surfaces multi-process holder info. When another MCP server
(Claude Code + Cursor + Codex on the same repo) holds the watcher slot, the
``watcher_holder`` field reports {pid, client_id, started_at, age_seconds}
so the agent knows a parallel session is live and our watcher is intentionally
idle for this repo.
