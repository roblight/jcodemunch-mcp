"""get_repo_health — one-call triage snapshot of a repository.

Aggregates results from individual tools to produce a structured health summary:
  - Symbol and file counts
  - Dead-code estimate (% of functions/methods with high dead-code confidence)
  - Average cyclomatic complexity
  - Top 5 hotspots (complexity × churn)
  - Dependency cycle count
  - Unstable module count (instability > 0.7 in the import graph)

Designed to be the *first* tool called in a new session.  One call gives a complete
triage picture with no follow-up needed.  All heavy lifting is delegated to individual
tools — no logic is duplicated here.
