"""Symbol resolution for runtime trace records.

Trace records arrive shaped as ``(file_path, line_no, function_name)`` —
the OTel `code.filepath` / `code.lineno` / `code.function` triple, or the
file/line/name extracted from a stack-frame line.  This module maps that
triple back to the indexed `symbol_id` it refers to.

Resolution strategy (best-effort, ordered):
  1. Exact (file, line) range match: smallest enclosing symbol whose
     ``line <= line_no <= COALESCE(end_line, line)``. Strongest signal.
  2. Exact (file, function_name) match when line is missing or the line
     range lookup misses (e.g., minified files, inlined dispatch).
  3. Suffix match on file path — accommodates trace records whose paths
     are absolute or rooted at a different prefix than the index. Falls
     through to a name-only match within the candidate file set.

A miss returns ``None`` and the ingest layer is responsible for recording
the unresolved record in ``runtime_unmapped`` for diagnostics. Phase 0 ships
the contract; Phase 1 wires it into an actual ingest pipeline.
