"""Git blame context provider — attaches last_author and last_modified to files.

History bound:
    The naive ``git log --name-only`` walks the entire commit history, which is
    fine on a fresh repo but pathological on a long-lived one — 25-30 s on a
    monorepo with hundreds of thousands of commits, easily blowing past the
    MCP client's request-timeout budget. We bound the work two ways:

      * ``-n GIT_BLAME_COMMIT_LIMIT`` caps the commit count
      * ``--since=GIT_BLAME_SINCE`` bounds the time window

    Together these mean blame data covers recent activity (where it matters
    for `last_author` / `last_modified` queries) without paying for ancient
    history. Files untouched in the window simply won't appear in the blame
    map, and ``get_file_context`` will return ``None`` for them — the same
    behaviour as files outside a git working tree.

Operator override:
    Setting ``git_blame_enabled = false`` in the project or global config
    short-circuits ``detect()`` so the provider never runs. Useful for huge
    histories where even the bounded walk is too slow.
